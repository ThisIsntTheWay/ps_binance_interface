# Binance PowerShell interface
A script to leverage Binance.com access using REST API calls.  
The script is able to save various data in a SQLite DB.  
As such, the module **PSSQLite** must be installed.

## Note
This is *not* a trading bot, nor does it offer the functionality of creating a trading strategy.
Although this is planned, there's other stuff that needs fixing at the moment.

This is more of a personal hobby project to learn a bit more about SQL, PS and REST API handling.
For serious trading
