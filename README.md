# Binance PowerShell interface
A script to leverage Binance.com access using REST API calls.  
The script is able to save various data into a SQLite DB.  
As such, the module **PSSQLite** must be available prior to use.

## Note
This is *not* a trading bot!  
Although there's the possibility of executing trades using JSON files, there's no possibility of executing trading strategies.  

This is more of a personal hobby project to learn a bit more about SQL, PS and REST API handling.  
There's better stuff out there for more serious trading.
